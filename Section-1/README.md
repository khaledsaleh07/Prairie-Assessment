In this section you're required to replicate the page is the "Assets" folder named "mockup-png". Use any mockup tool to design the wireframe mentioned in the "mockup-png" image and use HTML, CSS, JS, in order to develop a static web application. Try to estimate all the dimensions to get the most accurate result.

Use the file "Ergonomics" in order to get the exact font and color scheme so your design can have the exact ergonomics as mentioned in the mockup page.
